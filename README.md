Student Sorting Program


A simple C# console application that demonstrates a sorting algorithm to organize a list of students by their scores. This project utilizes the Bubble Sort algorithm for educational purposes.

Features


Add students with names and scores.
View the list of students before and after sorting.
Implements Bubble Sort, a classic algorithm, to sort scores in ascending order.
How It Works
Students are added to a list with their names and scores.
The program displays the students in the order they were added.
The Bubble Sort algorithm sorts the list by scores.
The sorted list is displayed.
Example Workflow
Students added:

Adina: 95
Anna: 68
Lars: 87
John: 78
Initial list (unsorted):

Adina: 95
Anna: 68
Lars: 87
John: 78
Sorted list (ascending order of scores):

Anna: 68
John: 78
Lars: 87
Adina: 95


My Learning Journey


This program was part of my journey to understanding sorting algorithms and their implementation in C#. It helped me:

Grasp the logic behind the Bubble Sort algorithm.
Practice basic object-oriented programming principles.
Gain hands-on experience with list manipulation in C#.
This project has been a rewarding step in building my programming knowledge and problem-solving skills.
