Student Sorting Program

This project demonstrates a simple algorithmic approach to sorting a list of students based on their scores. It's a C# console application that uses the Bubble Sort algorithm 
to organize students' scores in ascending order.

Features

Add students with their names and scores.
View the list of students before and after sorting.
Uses Bubble Sort, a classic sorting algorithm, for educational purposes.

How It Works
Students are added to a list with their names and scores.
The program displays the students in the order they were added.
The Bubble Sort algorithm is applied to sort the list by scores.
The sorted list is then displayed.

Example Workflow
Students are added:
Adina with a score of 95
Anna with a score of 68
Lars with a score of 87
John with a score of 78
Initial list (unsorted):


Adina: 95
Anna: 68
Lars: 87
John: 78

Sorted list (ascending order of scores):

Anna: 68
John: 78
Lars: 87
Adina: 95

My Learning Journey

This program was created as part of my journey to better understand sorting algorithms and their implementation in C#. 
Writing this application helped me grasp the logic behind Bubble Sort, while also practicing basic object-oriented programming and list manipulation. 
Itâ€™s been a fun and rewarding learning experience!

How to Run
Requirements:
.NET SDK installed on your system.
